# Matrix Multiplication

Matrices Multiplication app is a tool to multiply Matrices.

It will as ask you to input the number of rows and columns for 2 different Matrices then check compatibility. If the Matrices are compatible will ask you to input the values then provide you with the resulting new Matrix

To execute the app, you can download both .html and .js document on the same folder, then just open the .html document with your web browser.

I coded this app in 2 versions, Spanish and English.
